 * 
 *The factory design pattern is used when:- 
 *		--> we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. 
 *		--> This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.
 *
 *		Factory Design Pattern Advantages:
 *			--> Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
 *			--> Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. 
 *			--> Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend. 
 *			--> For example, we can easily change PC class implementation because client program is unaware of this.
 *			--> Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.
